The topic of the seminar is **Chaos as an Intermittenlty Forced Linear system**. This paper deals with controlling and predicting the behaviour of chaotic systems using data-driven approach with the help of machine learning techniques. A new approach called **HAVOK** analysis is developed in this work.

Pre-requisites:
- Introduction to Chaos theory
- Koopman operator theory
- Machine Learning
- Linear and sparse regression
